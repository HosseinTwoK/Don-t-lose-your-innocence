Don’t Lose Your Innocence is an intermediate-level Pygame project created purely as a practice project for a beginner developer. The game focuses on improving skills in sprite management, collisions, animation handling, and game structure design.

It’s not a full game yet, but rather a learning experiment to explore how Pygame works — from drawing graphics and handling input to building basic gameplay mechanics and visual effects.
